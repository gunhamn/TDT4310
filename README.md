## `TDT 4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding - Spring 2024`

Throughout this course, we will explore many aspects of natural language processing, starting with the very latest developments within language models - specifically *large* language models. From there on, we go back to learn more fundamental topics such as part-of-speech tagging, grammars, dependency parsing and tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

The five assignments (we call them labs) will, in one way or another, prepare you for the course project, accounting for 75% of the final grade. Information around the project will reside on Blackboard.

All labs will be provided as Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). The first lab (lab 0) will be a simple question-answer setup, to get familiar with the format, only involving markdown cells. Labs 1 through 4 will require you to properly use the environment with a mix of markdown and code cells.

### `üîß Lab setup`

Each lab will have files starting with the prefix `lab{N}`, ${N} \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Each lab will have at least two files:

- `lab{N}_description.md` - a description of the lab
- `lab{N}_exercises.ipynb` - the main notebook with the exercises
  - **you will submit this file to blackboard**

### `üìù Delivery`

By the deadline for each lab, you will submit your `lab{N}_exercises_{your-username}.ipynb` file to Blackboard. You can submit as many times as you want - only the last submission will be considered for pass/fail.

### `üìö Curriculum`

The course curriculum is mostly based around the 2022 book by *Ekaterina Kochmar* - Getting Started with Natural Language Processing. It is available on [Akademika](https://www.akademika.no/teknologi/data-og-informasjonsteknologi/getting-started-natural-language-processing/9781617296765).
