# `TDT 4310 - Intelligent Text Analytics and Language Understanding - Spring 2024`

Throughout this course, we will explore many core aspects of natural language processing, starting with the very latest developments within language models - specifically *large* language models. From there on, we move on to more traditional topics such as part-of-speech tagging, grammars, dependency parsing and tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling.

The four labs (and the first exercise) will hopefully prepare and motivate you for the course project, accounting for 75% of the final grade. Information around the project will reside on Blackboard.
